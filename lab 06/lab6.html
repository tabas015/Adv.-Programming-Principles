   <b>0. Introduction.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   In this laboratory assignment, you will write OCaml functions that perform
   operations on mutable queues. The queues will be implemented as circular
   doubly-linked lists with head nodes&#8212;sometimes called <i>symmetric
   lists.</i> Queues and symmetric lists are commonly discussed in a data
   structures course, like the one that is a prerequisite for
   CS<small>CI</small> 2041. This assignment assumes that you are familiar
   with them.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>1. Theory.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   We&rsquo;ll start with some terminology. A <i>singly-linked list</i> is
   built from zero or more <i>nodes,</i> each of which has a pointer to
   the node that follows it. A <i>doubly-linked list</i> is also built
   from zero or more nodes, but now each node has a pointer both to the node
   that precedes it, and to the node that follows it. A <i>circular
   doubly-linked list</i> is a doubly linked list of zero or more nodes,
   whose last node (if any) points to its first node, and vice versa. A
   <i>circular doubly-linked list with a head node</i> is a
   circular-doubly linked list of one or more nodes. Within the list, a
   <i>head node</i> eliminates special cases when adding nodes to the
   list, or when deleting nodes from the list.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, the following diagram shows a
   circular doubly-linked list with a head node (pointed to by the variable
   <tt>head</tt>). Each node has a <i>left pointer,</i> a data object
   called an <i>element</i> (shown as an upper case letter), and a
   <i>right pointer.</i>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <img border="0" src="cdll.png">
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   Note that the head node is <i>always</i> present, even in an empty
   list. If the list is empty, then the left and right pointers of the head
   node point back to the head node itself.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A <i>queue</i> is a finite, ordered
   series of elements, in which all additions occur at one end, called the
   <i>rear</i> of the queue, and all deletions occur at the opposite end,
   called the <i>front</i> of the queue. For example, a line of people
   waiting to enter a theater is a queue, because people join the line at the
   rear, and leave the line at the front.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A circular doubly-linked list with a head
   node can implement a queue. The rear of the queue is the node on the left of
   the head node (with element <i>E</i> in the diagram). When we add a new
   element to the queue, we add the node containing the element on the left of
   the head node. Similarly, the front of the queue is the node on the right of
   the head node (with element <i>A</i> in the diagram). When we delete an
   old element from the queue, we delete the node containing the element on the
   right of the head node.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we implement a queue in this way, then we
   need not make special case tests to determine if the queue is empty. This is
   because the queue is <i>never</i> empty&#8212;the head node is always
   present.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>2. Implementation.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   For this laboratory assignment, you must implement your queue as a circular
   doubly-linked list with a head node. Each node in the list has the type
   <tt>'base</tt>&nbsp;<tt>mutyQueue</tt>, which is defined as
   follows.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <tt>type&nbsp;'base&nbsp;mutyQueue&nbsp;=&nbsp;</tt>
    <br />
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;MutyQueueNode&nbsp;</tt>
    <br />
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;'base&nbsp;&#8727;&nbsp;</tt>
    <br />
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'base&nbsp;mutyQueue&nbsp;ref&nbsp;&#8727;&nbsp;</tt>
    <br />
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'base&nbsp;mutyQueue&nbsp;ref&nbsp;;;</tt>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">
   Each node has three parts: an immutable <i>element</i> of type
   <tt>'base</tt>, a variable <i>left pointer,</i> whose value
   has the type <tt>'base</tt>&nbsp;<tt>mutyQueue</tt>, and a
   <i>right pointer,</i> whose value also has the
   <tt>'base</tt>&nbsp;<tt>mutyQueue</tt>.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must write the following functions. They
   perform operations on the circular doubly linked lists that implement
   queues.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <dl compact="compact">
    <dt>
     <p>
      <tt>mutyQueueMake s</tt>
     </p>
    </dt>
    <dd>
     <p align="justify">
      Return the head node of a new queue, whose element is <tt>s</tt>,
      and whose left and right pointers point back to the head node itself. The
      element <tt>s</tt> will be returned if you try to dequeue an element
      from the queue when it is empty. The queue has type
      <i>t</i>&nbsp;<tt>mutyQueue</tt>, where <i>t</i> is the
      type of <tt>s</tt>.
     </p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
     <p>
      <tt>mutyQueueEmpty q</tt>
     </p>
    </dt>
    <dd>
     <p align="justify">
      Test if the queue with head node <tt>q</tt> is empty. Return
      <tt>true</tt> if it is, and return <tt>false</tt> if it is not.
      Do not change <tt>q</tt> in any way!
     </p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
     <p>
      <tt>mutyQueueEnqueue q e</tt>
     </p>
    </dt>
    <dd>
     <p align="justify">
      Add a node to the left of the head node <tt>q</tt>. This node
      contains the element <tt>e</tt>. Return <tt>()</tt>.
     </p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
     <p>
      <tt>mutyQueueDequeue q</tt>
     </p>
    </dt>
    <dd>
     <p align="justify">
      If <tt>q</tt> is empty, then return <tt>s</tt> from
      <tt>mutyQueueMake</tt> above. Otherwise, get the node on the right
      of the head node <tt>q</tt>. It contains the element
      <tt>e</tt>. Delete that node and return <tt>e</tt>.
     </p>
    </dd>
   </dl>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">
   Here are some hints.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
   <p align="justify">
    All these functions must run in <i>O</i>(1) time, without loops or
    recursions.
   </p>
   <li>
   <p align="justify">
    Most objects in OCaml are really accessed through pointers, although the
    language doesn&rsquo;t make that explicit. Some other languages, such as
    Python, treat objects in the same way.
   </p>
   <li>
   <p align="justify">
    Queues are represented by pointers to their head nodes. Whenever you see
    <tt>q</tt> in the above descriptions, it means a pointer to the head
    node of a circular doubly-linked list.
   </p>
   <li>
   <p align="justify">
    The function <tt>mutyQueueMake</tt> must make a head node, whose left
    and right pointers point back to the head node itself. Such a node can be
    made easily using <tt>let</tt>&nbsp;<tt>rec</tt>, like this. Code
    to initialize the head node&rsquo;s element goes in place of
    &lsquo;&lsquo;<tt>...</tt>&rsquo;&rsquo;.
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     <tt>let&nbsp;rec&nbsp;h&nbsp;=&nbsp;MutyQueueNode&nbsp;(...,&nbsp;ref&nbsp;h,&nbsp;ref&nbsp;h)&nbsp;</tt>
     <br />
     <tt>in&nbsp;h</tt>
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p align="justify">
    Do not make a node and then assign values to its left and right pointers,
    as you would in an imperative programming language&#8212;that will not work
    in OCaml.
   </p>
   <li>
   <p align="justify">
    Use <tt>match</tt>&#8211;<tt>with</tt> to access the elements,
    left pointers, and right pointers of nodes. Note that the left and right
    pointers are <i>variables</i>&#8212;they are <i>not</i> the
    values of variables! If <i>v</i> is a variable, then
    <tt>!</tt>&nbsp;<i>v</i> returns <i>v</i>&rsquo;s value, and
    <tt>ref</tt>&nbsp;<i>x</i> returns a variable whose value is
    <i>x</i>. Also,
    <tt>ref</tt>&nbsp;<tt>!</tt>&nbsp;<i>v</i> makes a new
    variable with the same value as <i>v</i>.
   </p>
   <li>
   <p align="justify">
    The function <tt>mutyQueueEmpty</tt> must test if the left and right
    pointers of the head node point back to the head node. To make this test,
    use the OCaml operator &lsquo;<tt>==</tt>&rsquo;. It tests if two
    pointers point to the same object. Do <i>not</i> use
    &lsquo;<tt>=</tt>&rsquo;, because it will try to traverse your
    circular lists and run out of stack space.
   </p>
   <li>
   <p align="justify">
    When <tt>mutyQueueEnqueue</tt> adds a new node from a queue, then it
    must still be circular after the node is added. When
    <tt>mutyQueueDequeue</tt> removes an old node from a queue, then it
    must still be circular after the node is removed. <i>Never</i> delete
    the queue&rsquo;s head node!
   </p>
   <li>
   <p align="justify">
    If you write <tt>mutyQueueDequeue</tt> correctly, then you will not
    have to make a special case check for an empty list. The same code that
    deletes a node from a non-empty list will leave an empty list (with just a
    head node) unchanged, and will return the element in the head node.
   </p>
  </ul>
