   <b>0. Introduction.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   In this programming project, you will write an OCaml module whose functions
   read Lisp <i>thing</i>&rsquo;s from a file. It will use the token
   scanner from Lab 9, in a module called <tt>Scanner</tt>. This is the
   last major piece of the Lisp interpreter that you will write. If we have a
   function that reads Lisp <i>thing</i>&rsquo;s, a function that
   evaluates Lisp <i>thing</i>&rsquo;s, and a function that prints Lisp
   <i>thing</i>&rsquo;s, then we could put them all together to make a
   complete Lisp system.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>1. Theory.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   In formal language theory, a <i>language</i> is a set of strings; a
   <i>string</i> is a sequence of characters. A <i>grammar</i> is a
   mathematical description of a language that tells which strings are in the
   set, and which strings are not. One way to specify a grammar is to use
   mathematical rules, but we won&rsquo;t do that here. Instead, we&rsquo;ll
   use a directed graph called a <i>syntax diagram.</i> A syntax diagram
   for Lisp <i>thing</i>&rsquo;s is shown below.
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <img border="0" src="thing.png">
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   Every syntax diagram has a name: the name of this diagram is
   <b>thing</b>. It has exactly one arrow that lets you enter the diagram
   on the left, and exactly one arrow that lets you exit the diagram on the
   right. By following arrows from left to right, going all the way through the
   diagram, you can tell what sequences of characters can be
   <i>thing</i>&rsquo;s.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The box labeled <b>thing</b> stands for
   a Lisp <b>thing</b>. The diagram is recursive, because it is defined in
   terms of itself: there is a box labeled <b>thing</b> inside the diagram
   labeled <b>thing</b>. The box labeled <b>number</b> is a Lisp
   number token (from Lab 9). It&rsquo;s a sequence of one or more digits,
   &lsquo;<tt>0</tt>&rsquo; through &lsquo;<tt>9</tt>&rsquo;,
   preceded by an optional minus sign &lsquo;&#8722;&rsquo;. The box labeled
   <b>symbol</b> is a Lisp symbol token (also from Lab 9). It&rsquo;s a
   sequence of one or more characters other than blanks, newlines, and
   parentheses. There is no box labeled <b>nil</b>, because it&rsquo;s
   simpler to pretend that <tt>nil</tt> is a <b>symbol</b>, even
   though it really isn&rsquo;t (see below).
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are some examples of
   <i>thing</i>&rsquo;s that are described by the diagram. A number, like
   <tt>100</tt>, is a <i>thing,</i> because we can start on the left,
   follow arrows to the box labeled <b>number</b>, and then follow arrows
   out of the diagram again. A symbol, like <tt>hello</tt>, is also a
   <i>thing,</i> because we can start on the left, follow arrows to the
   box labeled <b>symbol</b>, and then follow arrows out of the diagram.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An empty list, like <tt>()</tt>, is a
   <i>thing,</i> because we can follow an arrow to the circle labeled
   &lsquo;<b>(</b>&rsquo;, follow an arrow to the circle labeled
   &lsquo;<b>)</b>&rsquo;, and then follow an arrow out of the diagram. In
   Lisp, <tt>()</tt> is just another notation for <tt>nil</tt> (see
   below).
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A list, like <tt>(a&nbsp;b&nbsp;c)</tt>,
   is a <i>thing</i>, because we can follow an arrow to the circle labeled
   &lsquo;<b>(</b>&rsquo;, and then to the box labeled <b>thing</b>.
   We imagine that a copy of the diagram <b>thing</b> appears in place of
   that box. If we follow arrows through that copy, then we find that
   <tt>a</tt> is also a <i>thing.</i> If we go around the loop, back
   to the box labeled <b>thing</b>, we find that <tt>b</tt> is
   another <i>thing</i> in the same way, and if we go around the loop
   again, we find that <tt>c</tt> is a <i>thing</i> as well. When we
   exit the loop, we follow an arrow through a circle labeled
   &lsquo;<b>)</b>&rsquo;, and then follow yet another arrow out of the
   diagram.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We could show that nested lists like
   <tt>((a)&nbsp;b&nbsp;c)</tt> and <tt>(a&nbsp;(b&nbsp;c))</tt> are
   <i>thing</i>&rsquo;s too, by following arrows through the diagram in
   the same way. And we could show that something like
   &lsquo;<tt>)x(()5(</tt>&rsquo; is not a <i>thing,</i> because
   there is no way to follow arrows through the diagram given its characters.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>2. Implementation.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   For this project, you must write an OCaml module called
   <tt>Parser</tt>, whose type is the OCaml signature
   <tt>Parsers</tt>. (A <i>parser</i> is a procedure that reads a
   series of tokens and constructs a representation of what the tokens stand
   for.) The module <tt>Parser</tt> will use functions defined in the
   module <tt>Scanner</tt> from Lab 9. Although <tt>Parser</tt> may
   contain many functions, only two OCaml objects must be visible outside it:
   the exception <tt>Can'tParse</tt>, and the function
   <tt>makeParser</tt>, both of which are described below.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <dl compact="compact">

     </p>
    </dt>

      (5 points.) Signature. This signature must describe the function
      <tt>makeParser</tt> and the exception <tt>Can'tParse</tt>,
      but nothing else.
     </p>
    </dd>
    <dt>

      <tt>Can'tParse message</tt>
     </p>
    </dt>
    <dd>

      (5 points.) Exception, where <tt>message</tt> is a string. This must
      be raised by the functions described below if they can&rsquo;t read a
      <i>thing</i>.

      must contain definitions for the exception <tt>Can'tParse</tt>,
      along with the functions <tt>makeParser</tt>,
      <tt>nextThing</tt>, and <tt>nextThings</tt>. It may also
      contain definitions of other objects, but only <tt>makeParser</tt>
      and <tt>Can'tParse</tt> must be visible outside
      <tt>Parser</tt>.
     </p>

      (10 points.) Return a parser: a new function that takes the OCaml unit
      object <tt>()</tt> as its only argument. (Do not confuse the OCaml
      unit object <tt>()</tt> with the Lisp list <tt>()</tt>!) Each
      time it is called, the parser reads the next Lisp <i>thing</i> from
      the file whose pathname is the string <tt>path</tt>, and returns
      that <i>thing.</i>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The function <tt>makeParser</tt> must
      make a scanner (like the one from Lab 9) by calling
      <tt>Scanner.makeScanner</tt>. It must also make a variable called
      <tt>token</tt>. The scanner reads tokens from the file whose
      pathname is <tt>path</tt>. The variable <tt>token</tt> holds
      the token most recently read by the scanner. The scanner and the variable
      must be visible to the parser returned by <tt>makeParser</tt>, but
      invisible to all other functions.

      (10 points.) This function does all the work for the parser returned by
      <tt>makeParser</tt>. It examines <tt>token</tt> and uses it to
      decide what kind of <i>thing</i> it will read. Then it reads the
      <i>thing,</i> constructs an OCaml object which represents that
      <i>thing,</i> and returns the object. It does this in the following
      way.

  <p align="justify">
   Here are some hints about how to write these functions. The scanner and the
   parser are designed according to similar rules, as follows.
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>
   <p align="justify">
    The scanner read characters. The parser reads tokens.
   </p>
   <li>
   <p align="justify">
    The scanner used a variable <tt>ch</tt> to hold the most recently read
    character from a file. The parser uses a variable <tt>token</tt> to
    hold the most recently read token from a file.
   </p>
   <li>
   <p align="justify">
    The scanner was able to tell what kind of token it was about to read by
    examining the first character of that token (in <tt>ch</tt>). The
    parser is able to tell what kind of <i>thing</i> it is about to read
    by examining the first token of that <i>thing</i> (in
    <tt>token</tt>).
   </p>
   <li>
   <p align="justify">
    Whenever a function in the scanner was called, <tt>ch</tt> always held
    the first character of the token to be read. Whenever a function in the
    parser is called, <tt>token</tt> always holds the first token of the
    <i>thing</i> to be read.
   </p>
   <li>
   <p align="justify">
    Whenever a function in the scanner returned, <tt>ch</tt> always held
    the next character after the token that was just read. Whenever a function
    in the parser returns, <tt>token</tt> always holds the next token
    after the <i>thing</i> that was just read.
   </p>
  </ol>
  <p align="justify">
   To make some of these rules work, it is necessary to skip tokens after they
   are read. If <tt>nextToken</tt> is the name of the scanner created by
   <tt>makeParser</tt>, then we can skip a token by writing
   <tt>token</tt>&nbsp;<tt>:=</tt>&nbsp;<tt>nextToken</tt>&nbsp;<tt>()</tt>.
   For example, after <tt>nextThing</tt> reads a
   <tt>SymbolToken</tt>, it must skip that token in this way.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>3. Examples.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   The file
   <a href="things.txt">
    <tt>things.txt</tt>
   </a>
   on Canvas contains a series of example Lisp expressions. They are the same
   ones that were used to test the printing function from Lab 10. The file
   <a href="testsP3.ml">
    <tt>testsP3.ml</tt>
   </a>
   on Canvas contains a series of calls to a parser created by
   <tt>makeParser</tt>. Each call reads the next Lisp expression from
   <tt>things.txt</tt>, converts it to an OCaml object, and prints that
   object.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can use <tt>things.txt</tt> and
   <tt>testsP3.ml</tt> to test whether your parser works. However, unlike
   the tests that come with lab assignments, the tests in
   <tt>testsP3.ml</tt> are not worth points! The TA&rsquo;s will grade
   this project by reading your code, not by counting how many tests succeed
   and fail.
