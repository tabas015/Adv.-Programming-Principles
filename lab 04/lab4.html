   <b>0. Introduction.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   <i>Continuation Passing Style</i> (<small>CPS</small>) is a form
   of programming in which functions do not return values. Instead, when a
   function is called, it is given another function, called its
   <i>continuation.</i> When the function produces a value, it calls its
   continuation with the value, instead of returning it. In this way, the same
   function can provide no values (by never calling its continuation), one
   value (by calling its continuation once), two values (by calling its
   continuation twice), etc. It can even provide <i>n</i> values, where
   <i>n</i> is a number not known in advance, by calling its continuation
   <i>n</i> times. In this computer laboratory, you will write a
   <small>CPS</small> function that produces all permutations of a list.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>1. Theory.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   Suppose that <i>l</i> is a finite list of zero or more distinct
   elements (so there are no duplicates). Then a <i>permutation</i> of
   <i>l</i> is either <i>l</i> itself, or else a list made by
   rearranging the elements of <i>l.</i> For example, the OCaml list
   <tt>[0;&nbsp;1;&nbsp;2]</tt> has six possible permutations, shown
   below.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <tt>[0;&nbsp;1;&nbsp;2]&nbsp;</tt>
    <br />
    <tt>[0;&nbsp;2;&nbsp;1]&nbsp;</tt>
    <br />
    <tt>[1;&nbsp;0;&nbsp;2]&nbsp;</tt>
    <br />
    <tt>[1;&nbsp;2;&nbsp;0]&nbsp;</tt>
    <br />
    <tt>[2;&nbsp;0;&nbsp;1]&nbsp;</tt>
    <br />
    <tt>[2;&nbsp;1;&nbsp;0]</tt>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">
   If <i>l</i> has <i>n</i> distinct elements, then it has
   <i>n</i>! permutations. This is because there are <i>n</i>
   possible choices for the first element of a permutation,
   <i>n</i>&#8722;1 choices for the second element, <i>n</i>&#8722;2
   choices for the third element, etc., until finally there is only one choice
   left for the last element. As a result, the total number of permutations is:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <i>n</i>! = <i>n</i> &#215; (<i>n</i>&#8722;1) &#215;
    (<i>n</i>&#8722;2) &#8943; &#215; 2 &#215; 1
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">
   As a result, the number of permutations rises very rapidly as the length of
   the list <i>l</i> increases. For example, a list of length with ten
   elements has 10!&nbsp;= 3628800 possible permutations.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now suppose we want to generate all possible
   permutations of a list; perhaps we want to know if one of them has an
   interesting property. Since there are so many permutations, it would take
   too much memory to generate them all and store them in another list. It
   would be better to generate them one at a time, so we need only the memory
   for a single permutation. This can be done in OCaml using
   <small>CPS</small>.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s a sketch of an OCaml function
   called <tt>permuting</tt> that generates permutations in this way. It
   takes three arguments: a continuation called <tt>etc</tt>, a list of
   distinct things that have been permuted called <tt>permutedThings</tt>,
   and a list of distinct things that have not yet been permuted called
   <tt>unpermutedThings</tt>. We do not care what the <i>things</i>
   are: they might be characters, numbers, strings, etc.
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>
   <p align="justify">
    If <tt>unpermutedThings</tt> is empty, then call <tt>etc</tt> on
    <tt>permutedThings</tt>, then stop.
   </p>
   <li>
   <p align="justify">
    If <tt>unpermutedThings</tt> is not empty, then choose a thing from
    <tt>unpermutedThings</tt> somehow. Make a new list of
    <tt>permutedThings</tt>, by adding the chosen thing to the front of
    <tt>permutedThings</tt>. Make a new list of
    <tt>unpermutedThings</tt>, by removing the chosen thing from
    <tt>unpermutedThings</tt>. Call <tt>permuting</tt> recursively
    with <tt>etc</tt>, the new <tt>permutedThings</tt>, and the new
    <tt>unpermutedThings</tt>.
   </p>
   <li>
   <p align="justify">
    Go back to step 2, but choose a different thing from
    <tt>unpermutedThings</tt> this time. Continue until all the things
    have been chosen once, then stop.
   </p>
  </ol>
  <p align="justify">
   Note that each time we call <tt>permuting</tt>, the list
   <tt>unpermutedThings</tt> is smaller. That means it will eventually
   become empty, so <tt>permuting</tt> will terminate at step 1. Also note
   that <tt>permuting</tt> is a <small>CPS</small> function: it never
   returns a permutation! Instead, every time it generates a permutation, it
   calls its continuation <tt>etc</tt>.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, you may wonder how we get the
   permutations, since they are generated but never returned. The answer is
   that the continuation <tt>etc</tt> contains code that processes each
   permutation&#8212;in other words, it <i>continues</i> the computation
   for each permutation.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>2. Implementation.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   For this laboratory assignment, you must write the following OCaml
   functions. Of course you may write more helper functions if you need them.
   Your functions must not use loops, mutable objects, or variables.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <dl compact="compact">
    <dt>
     <p>
      <tt>choose etc things</tt>
     </p>
    </dt>
    <dd>
     <p align="justify">
      Call the continuation <tt>etc</tt> on each member of the list
      <tt>things.</tt>
     </p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
     <p>
      <tt>allbut things thing</tt>
     </p>
    </dt>
    <dd>
     <p align="justify">
      Return a list that is like <tt>things</tt>, but in which the first
      appearance of <tt>thing</tt> has been removed.
     </p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
     <p>
      <tt>permute etc things</tt>
     </p>
    </dt>
    <dd>
     <p align="justify">
      Assume <tt>things</tt> is a list with distinct elements. Generate
      all possible permutations of <tt>things</tt>, one at a time. Each
      permutation is a list with the same elements as <tt>things</tt>, all
      but one of which has its elements in a different order. Call
      <tt>etc</tt> on each permutation.
     </p>
    </dd>
   </dl>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">
   Here are some hints.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
   <p align="justify">
    The function <tt>choose</tt> is a <small>CPS</small> function, so
    it does not return a useful value. If you write it in the obvious way, then
    it will return <tt>()</tt>. It may need to use the OCaml semicolon
    operator &lsquo;<tt>;</tt>&rsquo;.
   </p>
   <li>
   <p align="justify">
    The function <tt>allbut</tt> is not a <small>CPS</small>
    function: it returns a list. You wrote a function very much like
    <tt>allbut</tt> in the first laboratory assignment for this course.
   </p>
   <li>
   <p align="justify">
    The function <tt>permute</tt> is a <small>CPS</small> function,
    so it does not return a useful value. If you write it in the obvious way,
    then it will return <tt>()</tt>. It must use something like
    <tt>permuting</tt> (described in the previous section) as a helper. It
    must also use <tt>choose</tt> and <tt>allbut</tt> as helpers.
   </p>
  </ul>
  <p>
   <b>3. Deliverables.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   The file
   <a href="tests4.ml">
    <tt>tests4.ml</tt>
   </a>
   contains some tests, worth <b>30 points</b>. It also contains a
   definition of an OCaml function called <tt>printThings</tt> that prints
   lists. Insert your code into this file, then run it with OCaml. When you
   think your code is correct, then submit the file with your code in it. The
   lab TA&rsquo;s will tell you how and where to turn in your work. It must be
   submitted by <b>11:55 <small>PM</small></b> on <b>Tuesday,
   February 23, 2021</b>.
