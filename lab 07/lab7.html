   <b>0. Introduction.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   In this laboratory assignment, you will write functions that implement a
   hash table which resolves collisions by chaining. (You may have discussed
   such hash tables in a data structures course before CS<small>CI</small>
   2041.) It is similar to the hash table that was discussed in the lectures
   for use in memoization. However, this hash table is implemented in a
   somewhat different way, using mutable objects that contain variables.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>1. Theory.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   A <i>hash table</i> is a data structure that maps <i>keys</i> to
   their <i>values.</i> It supports operations that (1) add a new key and
   value to the table, (2) change the value associated with a key, and (3)
   delete a key and its value entirely.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One way to implement a hash table uses an
   array. Each element of the array is a linear linked list of nodes, called a
   <i>bucket.</i> Each node in the bucket contains a key, its value, and a
   pointer to the next node in the bucket (if there is one). The pointer to the
   next node lets us access the remaining nodes in the bucket that follow the
   first node.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now suppose that we want to find the value
   associated with a key. We call a <i>hash function</i> on the key,
   giving an index into the array. Then we obtain a bucket from the array at
   that index. We search the bucket for a node that contains the key. If we
   find it, then the node will also contain the key&rsquo;s value. If we
   don&rsquo;t find it, then the hash table assigns no value to the key.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The buckets are needed because the hash
   function may send many different keys to the same bucket. This is called a
   <i>collision.</i> However, if the hash function is correctly designed,
   then each key has an approximately equal probability of being sent to any
   bucket within the array. If we make the array big enough, then most buckets
   will either be empty, or will have only one or two nodes.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, buckets can be searched very
   quickly. It is possible to implement a hash table so that its operations can
   be performed in <i>O</i>(1) key comparisons, on average.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>2. Implementation.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   For this laboratory assignment, you will implement a hash table as an array
   of buckets, as described in the previous section. You must write an OCaml
   type and a few OCaml functions, described below. Unlike most Ocaml code
   written for this course, you will use variables to avoid copying.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <dl compact="compact">
    <dt>
     <p>
      <tt>('key, 'value) pair</tt>
     </p>
    </dt>
    <dd>
     <p align="justify">
      The type <tt>pair</tt> describes a list of key-value pairs for each
      hash table bucket. It must have two constructors, called
      <tt>NoPair</tt> and <tt>Pair</tt>. The constructor
      <tt>NoPair</tt> makes a <tt>pair</tt> with no parts,
      representing an empty list of <tt>pair</tt>&rsquo;s. The constructor
      <tt>Pair</tt> makes a <tt>pair</tt> with three parts: a
      <tt>key</tt>, a variable that holds a <tt>value</tt>, and a
      variable that holds a pointer to the next <tt>pair</tt> in the
      bucket. Since the <tt>value</tt> and the next <tt>pair</tt> are
      variables, they can be changed by assignment.
     </p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
     <p>
      <tt>hashDelete table key</tt>
     </p>
    </dt>
    <dd>
     <p align="justify">
      Use the function <tt>hash</tt> to find a bucket in
      <tt>table</tt>. Search that bucket for a <tt>Pair</tt> that
      contains <tt>key</tt>. If there is such a <tt>Pair</tt>, then
      delete it from the bucket. If there is no such <tt>Pair</tt>, then
      do nothing. Hint: do not copy the <tt>Pair</tt>&rsquo;s in the
      bucket, but rather delete only the <tt>Pair</tt> that contains
      <tt>key</tt>. See below for a longer version of this hint.

      no such <tt>Pair</tt>, then raise the exception
      <tt>NoSuchKey</tt>. Hint: the value will be a variable, so make sure
      to return the variable&rsquo;s value, not the variable itself.

      there is such a <tt>Pair</tt>, then reset the variable to

      new <tt>Pair</tt> to the front of the bucket. It contains
      <tt>key</tt> and a variable whose value is <tt>value</tt>.

  <p align="justify">
   Here are two helper functions that may be useful. The function
   <tt>hashMake</tt> returns a hash table. It is implemented as an array
   of length <tt>modulus</tt> whose elements are empty buckets
   (<tt>NoPair</tt>). Here <tt>modulus</tt> is assumed to be a prime
   number.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <tt>let&nbsp;hashMake&nbsp;modulus&nbsp;=&nbsp;</tt>
    <br />
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;Array.make&nbsp;modulus&nbsp;NoPair&nbsp;;;</tt>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">
   The function <tt>hash</tt> returns the index of a bucket within
   <tt>table</tt> that may have a <tt>Pair</tt> containing
   <tt>key</tt>. Here <tt>table</tt> was created by calling
   <tt>hashMake</tt>.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <tt>let&nbsp;hash&nbsp;table&nbsp;key&nbsp;=&nbsp;</tt>
    <br />
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;abs&nbsp;((Hashtbl.hash&nbsp;key)&nbsp;mod&nbsp;(Array.length&nbsp;table))&nbsp;;;</tt>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">
   And here is a hint about how to write <tt>hashDelete</tt>. Use a helper
   function, which might be called <tt>hashDeleting</tt>, to search a
   bucket from <tt>table</tt>. The function <tt>hashDeleting</tt> has
   three possible cases.
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>
   <p align="justify">
    If the bucket is empty, then return an empty bucket (<tt>NoPair</tt>).
   </p>
   <li>
   <p align="justify">
    If the first <tt>Pair</tt> in the bucket contains <tt>key</tt>,
    then return the rest of the bucket, not including the first
    <tt>Pair</tt>. There is a pointer to the rest of the bucket in the
    first <tt>Pair.</tt>
   </p>
   <li>
   <p align="justify">
    If the first <tt>Pair</tt> in the bucket does not contain
    <tt>key</tt>, then call <tt>hashDeleting</tt> on the rest of the
    bucket. Set pointer to the rest of the bucket, in the first
    <tt>Pair</tt>, to the result returned by <tt>hashDeleting</tt>.
   </p>
  </ol>
  <p align="justify">
   The function <tt>hashDelete</tt> should use <tt>hash</tt> to find
   the bucket in <tt>table</tt> that may contain <tt>key</tt>. It
   then calls <tt>hashDeleting</tt> on that bucket. It finally replaces
   the original bucket in <tt>table</tt> with the result returned from
   <tt>hashDeleting</tt>. In this way, <tt>hashDelete</tt> can delete
   the first <tt>pair</tt> from the bucket, in the same way that it
   deletes any other <tt>Pair</tt>, without needing a special case.
