(* MAKE STREAM. Return a new stream. THIS is the first element of the stream.
   STATE is an object that stores the stream's state somehow. The function NEXT
   takes THIS and STATE as arguments. It returns a 2-tuple with a new THIS and
   a new STATE inside it. *)

  ((this, state), next) ;;

(* FIRST. Return the first element of a stream. *)

let first ((this, state), next) =
  this ;;

(* REST. Return a stream with its first element removed. *)

let rest ((this, state), next) =
  (next this state, next) ;;

(* TAKE. Return a list of the first COUNT elements TAKEn from STREAM. *)

let rec take count stream =
  match count

(* NATURALS. A infinite stream of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ... We don't use
   STATE here, so we let it be the dummy unit object (). *)
