(* THING. The type of a Pure Lisp object, from the lectures. *)

    Closure of thing * thing * environment |

   YOUR CODE GOES HERE !!!

(* Tests begin here, simple ones first. The comments say what must be printed
   to get the points. Note that case matters, all the blanks must be in their
   right places, there must be no extra blanks, and everything printed must
   end with a newline. We don't care what PRINT THING returns, only what it
   prints. *)

printThing Nil ;;                                             (* 2 pts. nil *)

(* More complex tests involving lists. *)

(* The big finish. All that horror below is the internal OCaml form of Pure
   Lisp code that defines the factorial function. It looks like this when it's
   properly indented.

   (define !
     (lambda (n)
       (if
         (= n 0)
         1
         (∗ n (! (- n 1))))))

   Your function PRINT THING need not print in indented form, so it will print
   this instead, for 10 pts.

   (define ! (lambda (n) (if (= n 0) 1 (∗ n (! (- n 1))))))
*)

printThing
  (Cons (Symbol "define",
    Cons (Symbol "!",
     Cons
      (Cons (Symbol "lambda",
        Cons (Cons (Symbol "n", Nil),
         Cons
          (Cons (Symbol "if",
            Cons (Cons (Symbol "=", Cons (Symbol "n", Cons (Number 0, Nil))),
             Cons (Number 1,
              Cons
               (Cons (Symbol "*",
                 Cons (Symbol "n",
                  Cons
                   (Cons (Symbol "!",
                     Cons
                      (Cons (Symbol "-",
                        Cons (Symbol "n", Cons (Number 1, Nil))),
                      Nil)),
                   Nil))),
               Nil)))),
          Nil))),
      Nil)))) ;;

(* Soon we will write a function that reads Lisp expressions, so we don't have
   to look at things like this any more. *)
